<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Bachelor of Science graduate in Information Technology from KMUTT with practical experience in software
development and database engineering. During my internship at Agoda, I contributed to backend system
performance by creating and reviewing optimized SQL functions and stored procedures, ensuring code
quality and production readiness. I collaborated closely with developers to identify performance bottlenecks
and enhance database-driven functionality. Through academic projects and agile development
environments, I’ve designed end-to-end solutions, written clean and efficient code, and applied optimization
techniques to improve execution performance. Highly adaptable and eager to grow as a software engineer
with a strong foundation in database-centric development.</p>
